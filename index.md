# A Cooling Anamaly of White Dwarfs
Most white dwarf stars shine at the cost of cooling, but not all. Using the wonderful Gaia DR2 data, I discovered some weired high-mass white dwarfs stopping their cooling when they reach a specific mass-dependent temperature. This slowing-down or "stop" of cooling produces a "trafic jam" on the white dwarf cooling tracks, and was named the "Q branch" on the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. The corresponding temperatures of the Q branch is around the freezing temperature of the Coulomb plasma in white dwarf cores. However, I demonstrated that crystallization cannot produce such a strong delay effect, while another mechanism, i.e., the settling of neutron-rich 22Ne, can possibly produce this cooling anomaly. It seems a conspiracy of nature that the effect of 22Ne settling peaks around white dwarf freezing temperatures! Here is [our paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...886..100C/abstract) and the catalog of high-mass white dwarfs used in our study:

## Observations from Gaia
The Q branch is revealed by the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram (a luminosity vs. color plot) of white dwarf stars, obtained from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2). It is not only a pile-up or overdensity, but also a region with more fast-moving white dwarfs. We shall explain both of these features in one scenario, which requires an extra cooling delay produced by some mechanism around the branch. This poses a challenge to white dwarf models.

## Two populations of white dwarfs
To explain both the number-density enhancement and the velocity excess on the Q branch, There must exist a special population of high-mass white dwarfs, which is subject to an extra cooling delay on the branch. This plot shows a simulated animation of this two-population cooling scenario. Our detailed analysis shows that the fraction of the extra-delayed population is about 6%, and the delay is 8 Gyr long.

## Normal white dwarf cooling
White dwarfs cool down from the bright, blue end to the faint, red end of their cooling tracks. The cooling rate changes quite smoothly, so the number density of white dwarfs on this plot is also smooth.

## Extra-delayed cooling
We find that for some white dwarfs, they must experience a very severe slowing-down of cooling rate, which makes them pile-up on the Q branch. This effect create both an over-dense region on the plot and an older age than the normal cooling (upon and after the pile-up).

## The physics behind this cooling anomaly
With a simplified calculation, we found that the effective zone of 22Ne settling matches the Q branch very well on the H--R diagram. We look forward to numerical results from detailed white dwarf models.
